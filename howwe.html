        <h3>How we Recycle?</h3>
        <p>Recycling waste is essential for maintaining a sustainable environment. By converting used materials into new products, we reduce the need for raw resources, save energy, and decrease pollution. Recycling helps conserve finite resources like metal ores, petroleum, and trees while significantly cutting down greenhouse gas emissions linked to production processes. Not only does it keep valuable materials out of landfills, but it also supports economic growth by creating jobs in recycling and manufacturing industries. Simple acts of recycling—like separating your paper, plastics, and glass—can make a massive difference in our planet's health and longevity. </p>
